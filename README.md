The Riddler
For our final project I decided to do a simple maze game. I call this the riddler. You will move around the map and find different riddlers. You will click on them once you are near them and a riddle will pop up in the text box on the bottom. Most of these answers are one word and you have unlimited tries. Good luck. 
I used an array to create a grid that became my maze, from there I added barriers and killed the velocity if a player was near a barrier. This gave me some trouble but I was able to figure it out. Something I had trouble with was the barries for the maze.
